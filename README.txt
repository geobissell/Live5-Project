First of all I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity and for taking the time to look at this little project.
I had a lot of fun working on this. There is so much more that I would ideally have liked to do to further improve it and I know the art work isn't great but I hope it plays well.

You can force a win by setting "forced" to true in the WinningsScreen class. This will force 1 to 6 every spin so you can testall types of wins.

Thank you again for your time and I hope to speak to you soon.
